# Paragraph
The article I chose to read about is 'The Future of DevOps is No-Code.' What drew me to the article was the concept of no-code applications' place in a DevOps environment, as well as this class' relation to DevOps. I was surprised to find that I was aware of some low-code and no-code applications already, such as Wix and Square. I was even further surprised to be made aware of how cost-effective using 'citizen developers' would be to increasing productivity in a DevOps environment. The article has made me a little more eager to enter a DevOps environment knowing that the industry is projected to grow at a similar rate to the demand for DevOps professionals.
